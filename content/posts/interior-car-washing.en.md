When we bought our Peugeot 205, we had to clean the interior. Indeed, the seats were dirty, even stained in some places, the original color of the front carpets was starting to be questionable and the smell was not necessarily the most pleasant. So we set to work in order to feel good for the many kilometers that we will spend on board.

Here are the different steps of the cleaning.

### Fabrics and carpets
To make things easier, we started by removing the chairs and the bench. Moreover, on this model of 205, the armchairs are removable which facilitates certain tasks of cleaning.

To clean the carpets, we started by removing the dirt with vinegar and bicarbonate. The reaction produced starts by doing a first cleaning. We then cleaned the carpets with soda crystals diluted in water and detergent.

Finally, after drying, we used ammonia and a brush on the seat covers and carpet to revive the original colors. <span class="badge yellow">Warning</span> Ammonia can be very dangerous, wear gloves, goggles, a mask and get into a ventilated area.

### Plastics

For the plastics, we first washed them with water and black soap, then polished them with plastic renovator.

### Reassembly and result

We notice that the plastics have regained their former shine and the fabrics their original color.
