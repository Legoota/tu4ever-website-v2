In order to go back to our starting point in Jura, we decided to keep driving across beautiful sceneries. Our goal was to drive through Gorges du Verdon.
We kicked off in the morning near Draguignan by driving to the small village of Tourtour. It is a very pleasant village, especially during market day.

We kept on driving towards Sainte-Croix-du-Verdon, and the shore of Lac de Sainte-Croix.

A bit further, we found a lavender field on the roadside. While I was thinking about the perfect film photo, L√©o changed our artificial lavender air freshener by a real sprig of fresh lavender. What a great smell to keep on driving to Moustiers-Sainte-Marie.

We stopped at a beautiful point of view by the side of the road, to take a picture of the lake with our Peugeot 205. However, when we took the picture, we discovered that our car was playing hide and seek with a typical French car. Oops.

Here is the second picture, the one with our car. It was taken at "Point Sublime" ("Sublime point"), which is really not a stolen name.

As we kept driving towards the village of Rougon to take a break by the water, we drove by another point of view for the Gorges du Verdon. We stopped for a bit to enjoy the view.

Finally, we got to Lac de Castillon, for the last picture of this beautiful adventure.

As far as the rest of the itinerary is concerned, we went through Digne-les-Bains, Sisteron, and then we decided to drive a bit faster, by going on the highway, passing by Gap, Grenoble, all the way to our starting point in Jura.

This marks the end of an awesome week of adventure, from which we will keep great memories. We hope to have the chance of doing another similar journey some time in the future ...
