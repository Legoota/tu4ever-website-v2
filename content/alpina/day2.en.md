For this second day, a big stage is in sight. We started off with the climb of the famous Col du Lautaret (2057 m) and Col du Galibier (2642 m).

We were very lucky this day, there was no rain at all, we could enjoy a pleasant and radious sun all day long. We met up with a truly interesting Peugeot Talbot Samba built with sport in mind. We were lucky to talk and ride along with the owner on the downhill.

The next step was to go to another valley, passing by the Col du T√©l√©graphe. We struggled for a while on the hunt of a gas station, and once we managed to found one which was not empty, we were ready to drive all the way up to the Lac du Mont-Cenis.

After taking a break at the lake, we drove down to the city of Susa, at which point we started climbing a uphill of more than 1500 meters of positive elevation.

After over an hour of small winding road, we were on top of the Colle del Finestre, where we had a photography break, and we left a small mark of our presence.

On the other side of the pass, the mist lifted like a curtain. Fortunately, the itinerary indicates us to go higher again, over the clouds, to get to the Colle dell'Assietta using the eponym Via. We drove to our stop for the second night, the Rifugio dell'Assietta, where we had a joyful meal with other crews.
