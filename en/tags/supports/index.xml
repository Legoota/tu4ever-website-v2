      <description>During the rebuilding of the bumpers of our Peugeot 205, we noticed that the brackets that were holding them in the back were in bad shape due to rust. Also, since we replaced the original front skirt with a Peugeot 205 GTI skirt and decided to include the long-range headlights, we had to redesign the support parts.
Of course, these parts are available for purchase and not necessarily very expensive, but on one hand we wanted to reduce the cost of the project, and on the other hand we would have the pride of making some of the parts ourselves.</description>
