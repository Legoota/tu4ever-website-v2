To achieve this goal, we started the project TU4EVER to purchase a car, restore and prepare it ourselves.
We bought a 1997 Peugeot 205 Generation, powered by the infamous PSA TU3M engine.
After our various modifications (that we wrote about in our articles), we participated to the 2022 edition of Alpinaraid which was an amazing experience.<br /><br />
The story behind the name TU4EVER comes from the engine code <b>TU</b> which was used in a lot of cars made by Peugeot and Citroën (PSA), including our Peugeot 205 1.4L."""

Car mechanics hobbyist, biker and old car enthusiast, I often drive with the Citröen counterpart of the Peugeot 205, which was unfortunately not as famous as the later, 
a 1991 Citroën AX. I also like mountain biking, hiking and travelling.<br />Currently in the last year of an engineering degree in IT in internship, where I met Léo K and where this project was born.<br /><br />
I am Léo K, born in Alsace, I have always enjoyed the various landscapes that this place can offer. I also graduated from the same IT engineering degree as Léo B, during which we started this raid project.<br />
I really enjoy flying stabilized and unstabilized (FPV) drones, playing with electronics (vintage Hifi, mechanical keyboard building, FPV drones)<br />I also truly enjoy car mechanics, a field where I would like to progress and learn new things."""
